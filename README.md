# Introduction

A database project developed for my database class at La Sapienza University. The task was to develop a relational database starting from the conceptual scheme up to the implementation of the database with a DBMS of our choice. I chose SQLite, which gave me little to no trouble when I had to develop the python application needed to interact with it. The python application runs on command line and it gives the possibility to the user to add entries to the database and to run some query as well. There a total number of 19 operations that can be performed by the application.

## Technologies

* Python 3.9
* SQLite

## Setup

To run the python application on Linux, go to the "Source Code Application" folder and open a terminal, then, run this:

```
python3 database.py
```

## Report

You can find the complete report inside the Report folder. You will find two files, one for the report of the developing process of the database structure, and one for the queries.

## What I Learned

I learned how to develop a relational database from scratch and how to develop queries to inquere it. Furthermore, I learned how to create a small python application to interact with a sqlite database.
